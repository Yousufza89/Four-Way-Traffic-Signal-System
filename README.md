# Four-Way Traffic Signal System

A microcontroller-based project to simulate a four-way traffic signal system using Arduino.

## Features

- Real-time traffic light simulation
- Automated signal transitions
- Timed delays between lights
- Can be expanded to include pedestrian crossing or sensors

## Hardware Used

- Arduino Uno
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Breadboard & Jumper wires
- Resistors

## Code Overview

The code runs an infinite loop where traffic lights at each of the four junctions turn ON and OFF in a timed sequence.

## How to Run

1. Connect the circuit as per schematic.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the board and observe the sequence.
